1.1	Quality and pertinence of the project’s research and innovation objectives (and the extent to which they are ambitious, and go beyond the state of the art)

Introduction— The proposed project targets fault-resilient coordination in multi-robot systems (MRSs) by tightly integrating modeling, control, planning, perception and diagnosis.  While MRSs offer significant advantages in scalability, flexibility, and redundancy, their deployment in real-world environments introduces critical challenges. These include sensor and actuator faults, loss of local autonomy, communication delays or dropouts, and uncertain and dynamic environments. Such challenges can severely degrade the overall system performance, jeopardize mission objectives, and compromise safety. Current architectures often treat perception, control and planning separately, yielding brittle behavior. This project therefore unifies six interlocking work plans (WPs) into a holistic safety framework. This proposal objective is to integrate visual perception, adaptive and learning-based control, fault diagnosis, and formal safety guarantees, aiming to enable the safe, reliable, and autonomous operation of large-scale robot teams under faults and uncertainties. To achieve this, Dr. Hamed Tirandaz will conduct the research at Sabancı University, Türkiye, under the supervision of Prof. Mustafa Unel.
State-of-the-art
Recent advances span each of the project’s work packages. Below we review the key developments around each WP, focusing on the recent achievements:
•	WP1 (Hybrid Dynamics Modeling & Parameter Identification): The dynamics of a multi agent robot system encompass the factors that drive the collective evolution of agent behaviors and interactions over time. Despite advances in collective robotics, theoretical tools for describing these dynamics remain scarce, often relying on high level metrics such as social entropy for diversity (Balch, 2000) or fluctuation measures around steady states (Lerman et al., 2006), and semi formal frameworks like ergodic dynamics (Shell et al., 2005). Traditional macro scale models—density/continuum approximations (Motsch & Tadmor, 2014; Topaz & Bertozzi, 2004) or simple kinematic emulators (Leonard et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2015)—fail to capture individual dynamics and local coupling laws, limiting their predictive power under heterogeneous or disturbed conditions.
Recent hybrid modeling methods overcome these limits by embedding physics priors into learning architectures. PINODE (Roehrl et al., 2020) integrates Lagrangian equations into neural ODEs for data efficient, physically grounded single agent models, while Agand & Shoorehdeli (2022) employ parallel neural networks with Lyapunov based updates to guarantee Uniform Ultimate Boundedness during online parameter adaptation. Grover’s 2023 CMU thesis further demonstrates that distributed observers can infer latent agent dynamics and inter agent coupling from trajectory data. Tools like SINDy (Brunton et al., 2016) and graph neural networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017) enable scalable discovery of governing equations and interaction rules. WP1 will synthesize these advances into a distributed framework that learns structured agent level models and interaction laws in real time, even under communication and sensory constraints.
•	WP2 (Multi-Robot Distributed Coordination & Control): 
Control architectures for multi-agent robot systems are broadly categorized as centralized, decentralized, and distributed [Furno2015, Alwafi2022, Stare2012, Soumya2020, Jimenez2018]. Centralized approaches rely on a leader to aggregate global data and command the team, incurring computational bottlenecks, high communication loads, and single points of failure, often demanding full network knowledge that are not unavailable in MRSs due to sensing limitations [Verma et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2009]. Decentralized strategies eliminate the leader by employing nearest-neighbour rules —each agent follows only its local neighbors—but typically lack formal performance guarantees under changing topologies or partial observability [Jadbabaie et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2004]. Distributed control strikes a balance: agents make decisions based on local sensing and peer-to-peer communication, thereby enhancing scalability, resilience, and collaborative autonomy in complex environments [Soumya et al., 2020; Jimenez et al., 2018].
Within distributed coordination, three dominant paradigms prevail. Consensus-based control drives agreement on shared states (e.g., position, velocity, task allocation) through iterative neighbor exchanges, with rigorous convergence under time-varying graphs [Olfati-Saber & Murray, 2004; Dimarogonas et al., 2012]. Behavior-based control composes complex group behaviors from modular primitives—such as obstacle avoidance, target tracking, and dispersion—offering real-time responsiveness at the cost of limited analytical guarantees [Jones, 2018]. Formation control maintains geometric patterns using position-, displacement-, or distance-based laws, leveraging graph rigidity or potential-field methods for shape preservation [Oh et al., 2015]. Recent enhancements include distributed adaptive control, which tunes coupling gains online to handle uncertain dynamics [Ren & Atkins, 2010], and sliding-mode control (SMC) for fast convergence and disturbance rejection in synchronization and leader–follower tasks [Chen et al., 2018; Bucak, 2020]. These distributed schemes have been shown effective in a variety of real-world applications, from search and rescue to agricultural monitoring and cooperative transport [Ismail, 2018], but still leave open the challenge of maintaining robust coordination under communication imperfections and evolving team composition.
•	WP3 (Safety Layer with Graph based Control Barrier Functions): 
Multi-robot systems (MRS) inherently rely on graph-based abstractions to model decentralized control strategies, where agents (nodes) interact via communication edges under nearest-neighbor rules. This topology governs both control-law execution and information flow, as formalized in foundational works by Lin et al. (2004), Cortés (2006), and Ji & Egerstedt (2007).
Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a leading method for ensuring safety —such as collision avoidance (Falconi & Gowal, 2015; Yasuda et al., 2011), deadlock resolution (Zhang2025, Chen2024), and connectivity maintenance (Yang2024)—into real-time control via convex optimization constraints [Ames et al., 2019]. However, most CBF implementations assume centralized information flow or idealized communications. Ballotta & Talak (2025) addresses this gap by formalizing distributed CBFs parameterized with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling each agent to compute safety constraints based solely on local neighbor states.
Graph-based representation of MRSs consider agents as nodes, communication/interaction as edges. Zhang et al. (2024) leverage this by introducing Graph CBFs (GCBFs): a single CBF certificate defined on a graph structure (parameterized by a GNN) that scales to large swarms. Their GCBF+ framework learns a global safety barrier for an arbitrary number of agents, outperforming hand-crafted multi-agent CBFs. However, it does not explicitly encode global topological safety metrics (e.g. network connectivity or group cohesion).
WP3 will design a real-time “safety filter” that fuses GCBFs with algebraic graph constraints. Specifically, we will encode connectivity and formation-shape requirements using lightweight CBFs based on graph Laplacians. Then, integrate these with the learned GCBF+ barrier to enforce both pairwise collision avoidance and global cohesion. Hence, the multi-robot system can maintain a communication backbone and formation automatically during task execution—capabilities beyond standard pairwise CBF methods.
•	WP4 (Safety Critical Motion Planning in Multi-Agent Robot Systems): 
Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) extends single-robot planning to teams, requiring the computation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories from start (S) to goal (G) for all agents in a shared workspace [Hvězda et al., 2017, Solis2021]. However, it is challenging, because finding the best collision-free paths are affected by dynamically changing environments due to the robots' movement. MRMP methods fall into three classes: (i) Coupled planners explore the full composite configuration space—e.g. composite RRT [LaValle, 1998]—ensuring completeness but suffering exponential complexity. (ii) Decoupled schemes, such as prioritized planning [Bennewitz et al., 2001], plan each robot independently and resolve conflicts afterward, risking deadlocks in narrow passages [Rashid et al., 2013]. (iii) Hybrid approaches like M* [Wagner & Choset, 2015] or Interaction Templates [Motes et al., 2019] selectively couple search only when interactions occur, improving efficiency but still facing spatial deadlocks and limited scalability. Path-planning algorithms (e.g. A*, Dijkstra [Khaluf et al., 2017]) operate on discrete graphs and handle static obstacles, yet they do not account for dynamic agents or timing constraints crucial to MRMP [Latombe, 1991]. 
Recent graph-based formulations model MRMP as path finding on reduced roadmaps: vertices represent agent waypoints or task states, following up leveraging Laplacian matrices for connectivity (Fax & Murray, 2004), and weighted adjacency for obstacle-dense zones (Yasuda et al., 2011). Further, sequence planning on graph abstractions enables efficient multi-agent route scheduling with algorithms like A* or Dijkstra’s [Khaluf et al., 2017].
Building on this foundation, WP4 advances the integration of distributed control with graph-based CBF safety into sampling-based motion planning, with considering both dynamic and static obstacles. This future work aims to explore how embedded barrier constraints and adaptive team geometry can be co-designed to produce collision-free, formation-aware motion plans in complex, dynamic environments.
•	WP5 (Multi-Sensor Perception & Navigation, Cooperation and Control Integration): Robust multi-robot operation hinges on reliable multi-sensor perception—fusion of vision, LiDAR, radar, and inertial measurements—to guide navigation and cooperative behaviors. State-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, such as ORB-SLAM2 [Mur-Artal & Tardós, 2017], and advanced LiDAR-camera fusion networks like L3-Net [Li et al., 2020] achieve high-accuracy localization but treat all sensor outputs as equally reliable. Deep uncertainty quantification methods—e.g., Deep Evidential Regression for depth estimation [Amini et al., 2020]—produce per-measurement confidence scores, yet these rarely inform downstream control. In distributed perception, frameworks like Distributed Visual SLAM [Civera et al., 2008] and cooperative object detection [Choudhary et al., 2020] improve robustness against occlusion, but they assume fixed control policies and perfect communications.
Meanwhile, in single-robot planning, perception-aware Model Predictive Control has been explored to account for vision noise [Patel & Erickson, 2021], and preliminary work on perception-driven Control Barrier Functions adapts safety margins to environment uncertainty [Kolathaya et al., 2022]. However, no existing multi-robot framework systematically closes the loop from real-time, multi-sensor confidence to distributed navigation, cooperation, and control adaptation, leaving teams vulnerable when sensor quality degrades.
Motivated by these investigations, WP5 will conduct an in-depth study of how real-time multi-sensor uncertainty metrics can be propagated through the communication network to adapt navigation and cooperation laws. We will evaluate the impact of confidence-driven adjustments—such as dynamic spacing, formation reconfiguration, and communication rate modulation—in simulation and targeted hardware experiments under challenging perceptual conditions, establishing foundational methods for resilient, context-aware multi-robot autonomy.
•	WP6 (Vision-Integrated Fault Diagnosis & FTC Coordination): Real-time fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FTC) are essential for multi-robot teams operating in unstructured and unpredictable environments. Traditional model-based FTC approaches use distributed observers—such as sliding-mode or unknown-input observers—to detect and accommodate actuator and sensor faults, with successful demonstrations on UAV swarms [Tirandaz et al., 2023; Parwani & Kaminer, 2021]. Data-driven FTC techniques employ machine-learning classifiers or deep neural networks to recognize fault signatures from telemetry, offering rapid detection but often lacking formal stability guarantees [Wang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023]. In parallel, recent work has explored vision-based FTC, where convolutional networks analyze onboard camera feeds to identify mechanical anomalies such as joint slips or rotor degradation in manipulators and UAVs [Kim et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022]. More recently, safety-focused neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been introduced—Zhang et al. (2024) fuse neural networks within CBF frameworks to maintain provable safety even under sensor failures, representing a pioneering end-to-end learning-based FTC approach with formal barrier guarantees.
Despite these advances, existing FTC methods in multi-robot systems remain largely reactive and siloed: vision-derived anomaly cues are seldom integrated directly into the safety-critical control layer, and team-level recovery under concurrent faults is underdeveloped. WP6 will bridge this gap by co-designing vision-integrated fault diagnosis with distributed CBF-based reconfiguration. We will develop algorithms that fuse visual anomaly detection—leveraging lightweight CNNs and optical-flow residuals—with formal CBF recovery strategies to reshuffle formations, reassign roles, and maintain mission objectives in the face of hardware or perceptual faults. Through simulation studies and controlled testbed experiments, WP6 will explore the interplay between perception reliability, barrier-based safety envelopes, and cooperative control adaptation, laying the groundwork for resilient, vision-driven fault-tolerant multi-robot autonomy.

Collectively, these references show that each component of the proposed project – from hybrid modeling to vision-based control, fault diagnosis, distributed FTC, and CBF-based safety – is grounded in cutting-edge research [some references here]. The project’s innovation lies in integrating these elements into a unified framework for multi-agent robot systems, going beyond the current state of the art by combining them for vision-guided, fault-aware coordination.
Objectives and Novelty— The overarching goal of this project is to develop a unified framework for robust navigation, coordination, and decision‐making in multi‐robot systems operating in uncertain, dynamic environments. By seamlessly integrating hybrid physics‐informed modeling, adaptive learning, distributed fault diagnosis, Control Barrier Function–based safety, and context‐aware perception, the framework will enable robot teams to perceive, predict, and adapt their behavior under sensor degradation, communication variability, and hardware faults—capabilities essential for collaborative and industrial applications. These innovations are organized into six interlocking Work Packages, each targeting a key research objective:
WP1 – Hybrid Dynamics Modeling & Parameter Identification: Develop structured, scalable agent‐level models that combine Lagrangian priors with online neural residual learning, incorporating visual feedback and interaction‐law inference for accurate, real‐time system identification. 
WP2 – Multi-Robot Distributed Coordination & Control: Design robust distributed control protocols—spanning consensus, behavior, and formation paradigms—with adaptive observers and sliding-mode or adaptive laws to maintain coordinated performance under network imperfections and model uncertainties.
WP3 – Safety Layer with Graph-Based Control Barrier Functions: Create a distributed safety filter by fusing GNN-parameterized Graph CBFs with algebraic graph constraints, formally guaranteeing collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance in large, dynamic teams.
WP4 – Safety-Critical Motion Planning in Multi-Robot Systems: Integrate distributed CBF constraints and graph Laplacian–driven formation scaling into RRT*-style sampling planners, yielding certifiably safe, formation-aware trajectories without centralized supervision.

WP5 – Multi-Sensor Perception & Navigation, Cooperation and Control Integration:
Close the loop between real‐time multi‐sensor confidence (vision, LiDAR, radar, IMU) and distributed navigation/control laws, dynamically adjusting formation tightness, inter‐robot spacing, and communication rates to maintain robust coordination under perceptual uncertainty.
WP6 – Vision-Integrated Fault Diagnosis & FTC Coordination: Develop an active diagnosis–recovery loop where vision‐based anomaly detection feeds into CBF-protected fault-tolerant reconfiguration, reshaping formations and reallocating roles to preserve mission objectives under hardware and perceptual faults.
Collectively, these objectives advance the frontier of multi‐robot autonomy by unifying perception, modeling, safety, and recovery into a coherent, scalable architecture suitable for real‐world deployment.
