Here is the comprehensive "Excellence" section covering all six WPs in detail, structured with Introduction, State-of-the-Art, and Objectives subsections:

### 1.1 Introduction: Hybrid Safety Challenges in Multi-Robot Systems  
Multi-robot systems (MRS) face **fundamental safety limitations** when operating in dynamic, unstructured environments due to three interconnected gaps: (1) **Model-uncertainty propagation** in hybrid robot dynamics (e.g., legged-aerial systems), (2) **distributed coordination fragility** under communication delays and faults , and (3) **tightly coupled perception-control integration** for real-time safety assurance. Current approaches treat safety, planning, and perception as isolated components, leading to catastrophic failures during hardware faults or environmental uncertainties. This project integrates **hybrid dynamics modeling**, **distributed barrier functions**, and **fault-adaptive perception** to establish a unified safety framework for heterogeneous MRS.

### 1.2 State-of-the-Art Analysis and Project Positioning  

#### **WP1: Hybrid Dynamics Modeling & Parameter Identification**  
**Literature:** Current hybrid models rely on piecewise-continuous dynamics [Ames2019] or learning-based approximations [Lopez2021], but struggle with **real-time parameter identification** during mode transitions (e.g., ground-aerial reconfiguration). Distributed identification methods [Janson2022] assume perfect communication, neglecting delay-induced drift .  
**Gaps:** No unified framework for **online uncertainty quantification** in heterogeneous MRS with hybrid modes. Delays exacerbate model mismatch during cooperative tasks .  

#### **WP2: Multi-Robot Distributed Safety-Critical Control**  
**Literature:** Barrier functions (CBFs) enforce safety via constrained optimization [Ames2019]. Distributed CBFs [Taylor2020] ignore communication delays, causing unsafe actions in networked systems . Recent delay-compensation predictors  lack adaptability to dynamic topologies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) show promise for scalable control [Ballotta2025] but lack formal safety guarantees.  
**Gaps:** Absence of **delay-robust CBFs** with topology adaptation and **GNN-based safety certification** for dynamic teams .  

#### **WP3: Safety Layer with Graph CBFs**  
**Literature:** Centralized safety filters [Chen2022] fail in distributed MRS. Decentralized CBFs [Vinod2022] handle pairwise collisions but not group constraints (e.g., formation cohesion). GNNs enable topology-aware control , but existing implementations are communication-heavy and lack real-time performance.  
**Gaps:** No **graph-theoretic safety layers** that encode topological constraints (e.g., connectivity maintenance) via **lightweight GNN-CBF fusion** .  

#### **WP4: Safety-Critical Motion Planning**  
**Literature:** Sampling-based planners [Čáp2015] lack dynamic constraint integration, while optimization-based methods [Zhou2022] suffer from computational intractability with CBFs. Recent CBF-RRT* variants [Li2023] are limited to static environments. Formation control via complex Laplacian  enables shape transitions but assumes obstacle-free spaces.  
**Gaps:** Inability to generate **certifiably safe trajectories** for MRS in dynamic environments with **obstacle-aware formation scaling** .  

#### **WP5: Multi-Sensor Perception-Adaptive Control**  
**Literature:** Visual-inertial odometry dominates perception [Chen2022], but fails under sensor faults. LiDAR-visual fusion [Queralta2020] lacks control integration, causing decision latency. Adaptive control methods [Abbaspour2023] ignore perception uncertainty.  
**Gaps:** Missing **closed-loop perception-control co-design** with **safety-bound adaptation** to perception confidence .  

#### **WP6: Vision-Integrated Fault Diagnosis & FTC**  
**Literature:** Model-based FTC [Shames2021] assumes known fault signatures. Learning-aided diagnosis [Vorotnikov2018] lacks temporal consistency guarantees. Distributed FTC architectures  cannot handle simultaneous actuator failures and environmental constraints.  
**Gaps:** No framework for **visual-lidar fused fault recovery** with **CBF-shielded coordination** under faults .
